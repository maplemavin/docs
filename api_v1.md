# Fullscreen Direct API V1
Use the Fullscreen Direct API to develop custom, standalone integrations with Fullscreen Direct.

### Under Development
The API is actively evolving - please check back here for updates and changes.

#### Updates

##### 2017-02-15
- All urls have been updated to use singular resource names. Any plural endpoints will continue to work as they are now aliased to the singular version for backward compatibility.
- Endpoints between content items, such as Photos, Events, Audio, etc, have been updated to be more consistent with having the same abilities on each endpoint, such as updating or creating, and sub-resource lists now have the same features.
- Store Item Creation endpoint now treats the 'store_item' as an optional namespacer, making it behave like other REST endpoints.

### Fork us on GitHub!
All of Fullscreen Direct's documentation is up on GitHub for you to fork, modify, and improve. Join us over there to request features, add suggestions, and report bugs. What are you waiting for? [Git to it!](https://github.com/stagebloc/docs)

# General Information
The root URL of the API is `https://api.fullscreendirect.com/v1/`. It can generally be assumed that writing endpoints use `POST` requests and reading endpoints use `GET` requests.

### Authorization
Connecting with the Fullscreen Direct API uses the OAuth 2.0 standard. You must first [create a Fullscreen Direct account](https://www.fullscreendirect.com/signup) and then register your application in the Fullscreen Direct backend to receive a client ID and secret that will allow users to connect with your application. To do this, click on your account at the top of the page and then "Account Settings" followed by "Developer Center".

Requests can be be made with just a `client_id` parameter, but this is restricted to reading (listing) endpoints. In order to make use of any writing (editing) endpoints, an access token (i.e. validated user) must be present.

### Responses
All dates returned are in `GMT / UTC (+0000)` unless otherwise specified. The format of these dates follows PHP [`date() function`](http://php.net/date) function and is `Y-m-d H:i:s` (i.e. `2014-01-01 12:00:00`).

Responses are returned as `JSON`. To receive a `JSONP` response, include a `GET` parameter named `jsonp` specifying the name of your callback method.

Often times, large objects will be returned with just their ID instead of the whole object if they are nested within the main response. To have these objects expanded, just pass a `GET` parameter named `expand` with the comma separated string of the keys you want to expand. For instance, passing `expand=user` would then return the JSON for an entire user as opposed to just the ID of that user.

There are a lot of different model objects represented in the API. If you pass `expand=kind` with your requests, each object type will have a unique `kind` key in the JSON with a value of the object that the JSON structure represents. This can be useful for knowing what type of object to parse that JSON into if you're using native objects in your language as opposed to just arrays.

The general structure of a success response can be seen below.  The `data` key will contain the actual response data whereas the `metadata` key will contain informational content about the request.

    {
        "metadata": {
            "http_code": 200
        },
        "data": {
            ...
        }
    }

The general structure of an error response can be seen below.

    {
        "metadata": {
            "code": 400,
            "error_type": "InvalidData",
            "error": "The error string to present to the user",
            "dev_notes": "Some notes to help a developer debug the issue"
        },
        "data": null
    }

# Authentication
Fullscreen Direct uses the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) authentication process to get an access token from a request token. The access token is then used to make all subsequent requests.

Access tokens can be revoked on a per-application basis at any point in time by the user in their settings area in the Fullscreen Direct backend.

Depending on the endpoint, differing levels of authentication exist. Some endpoints require that the authenticated user be a fan while other require that they be an admin of the account. For those that require being an admin, some require a specific level of admin privileges, such as an editor or an author. Appropriate error messages will be shown if you try to access an endpoint you don't have access to.

A `client_id` must usually be passed with each request depending on the authentication level of that endpoint. However, if the request is made on behalf of an authenticated user, a `client_id` is not necessary.

Once an access token is received, it should be passed with the request as an HTTP header: `Authorization: OAuth <access token here>`

Account content:
> <p> requests without authentication or with non-fans will receive only non-exclusive content, except [audio](/developers/api/v1/audio/list) and [store item](/developers/api/v1/store-and-commerce/list--store-item) list endpoints which return all content.
> <p> requests identifying a fanclub member (with the `honor_exclusivity` query string parameter) will receive content exclusive to their fanclub tier as well as non-exclusive content.
> <p> requests identifying an account administrator will receive all content regardless of its exclusivity.

## List
`[GET] /account/fanclub/{type}`

This endpoint retrieves a listing of Fan Clubs on Fullscreen Direct. The accepted values for `type` are `following`, `featured`, or `recent` with `featured` being the default. Note that for `featured` Fan Clubs, `limit` and `offset` are ignored as it will return all featured Fan Clubs at the time.

### GET Parameters

`limit`
> <p> the number of items to limit the response to
> <p> accepted values are any positive number
> <p> defaults to 20

offset
> <p> how much to offset the returned items by
> <p> accepted values are any number greater than or equal to zero
> <p> defaults to 0

## Retrieve
`[GET] /account/{accountId}/fanclub`

This will return the details about the Fan Club.

## Update
`[POST] /account/{accountId}/fanclub`

This will create or update a Fan Club that belongs to the account with the given `accountId`.

### POST Parameters

`title`
> <p> The title of the Fan Club as a whole (as opposed to any tier)

`description`
> <p> The description of the Fan Club as a whole (as opposed to any tier)

`moderation_queue`

# Content Actions
Fullscreen Direct as a network has a lot of social functionality built in that allows fans to interact with content. Those endpoints are outlined here.

## List Likes
`[POST] /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/like`

`contentType`
> <p> can be one of `audio`, `audio/playlist`, `blog`, `event`, `photo`, `photo/album`, `status`, `store`, `video`, `video/playlist`.

This will return a list of users who have liked this content.


## Like
`[POST] /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/like`

`contentType`
> <p> can be one of `audio`, `audio/playlist`, `blog`, `event`, `photo`, `photo/album`, `status`, `store`, `video`, `video/playlist`.

This endpoint is used for liking content.

## Unlike
`[DELETE] /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/like`

`contentType`
> <p> can be one of `audio`, `audio/playlist`, `blog`, `event`, `photo`, `photo/album`, `status`, `store`, `video`, `video/playlist`.

This will remove a like from a piece of content.

Upon a successful like (or removal of a like), the JSON returned will simply be the same you'd receive from a `/account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}` `GET` request.

## Flag Content
`[POST] /account/{accountId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/flag`

`contentType`
> <p> can be one of `audio`, `blog`, `photo`, `status`, `video`.

Flag content for account moderation. This mostly applies to fan submitted content within Fan Clubs to ensure the content is kept at a high standard.

### POST Parameters

`type`
> <p> The type of flagging this is.
> <p> Accepted values are `duplicate`, `offensive`, `copyright`, or `prejudice`.

`reason`
> <p> This specifies why the user is flagging this content and should be a sentence or two provided by the end user using your application.
